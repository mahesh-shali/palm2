## Introduction

LangChain is a powerful framework for building language models, and PaLM 2 is a state-of-the-art model for natural language understanding. This project showcases how to combine these tools to create robust NLP applications.

## Features

- Integration with PaLM 2
- Modular and extensible architecture
- Sample applications and use cases

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mahesh-shali/palm2.git
    cd palm2
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Set up your environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your PaLM 2 API key:

    ```plaintext
    PALM2_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

2. **Run the main script:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

   Replace `main.py` with the actual entry point of your application.

## Configuration

All configuration settings are managed through the `.env` file and the `main.py` script. Ensure that your API keys and other sensitive information are correctly set up in the `.env` file.
